ðŸš€ Code Achievement Alert! ðŸš€

Today, I challenged myself by building a fun "Guess the Number" game in TypeScript, where a random number between 1 and 100 is generated, and the user tries to guess it with feedback on each attempt. ðŸŽ¯

This project helped me solidify my understanding of:

Handling user input in TypeScript using readline

Conditional logic for comparing guesses

Recursive functions for repeated guessing attempts

I'm excited about how far Iâ€™ve come in TypeScript development and look forward to more projects that push my coding skills to the next level! ðŸ’»ðŸ”¥
